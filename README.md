## Database Description

This database, FoliageDB, consists of a collection of 699 images of healthy and infected leaves from five different types of popular vegetable and flower species. The species included in the database are:

1. Wax gourd (Scientific name: Benincasa hispida) - 100 images
2. Garlic (Scientific name: Allium sativum) - 182 images
3. Onion (Scientific name: Allium cepa) - 132 images
4. Cucumber (Scientific name: Cucumis sativus) - 105 images
5. Tuberose (Scientific name: Polianthes tuberosa) - 180 images

The healthy and diseased leaves were collected directly from farmlands located in Gocharan, a village in Baruipur sub-division, South 24 Parganas district, West Bengal, India, and Kanchrapara, a city in the North 24 Parganas district, West Bengal, India. The images were captured using a One Nord Plus smartphone with the following camera specifications: 48 OIS+8+5+2 MP Quad Camera; 32+8 MP Dual Front Camera. The images were taken with a uniform white background and under varied illumination conditions.

All images in FoliageDB have a fixed resolution of 1800x4000 pixels and are stored in .jpg format.

The motivation behind FoliageDB is to address the challenge of automated identification of leaves with similar patterns. The selected vegetable and flower species were chosen due to their high inter-class similarities in leaf patterns, which can lead to ambiguities and poor performance of machine learning and deep learning approaches in leaf identification.
